# Greetings!
## And welcome to Brian Mallari's Data Science Website

My name is Brian Mallari. I've acquired my master's degree in May 2019 from Rutgers University with a concentration in data science.
This site is designed to showcase some of my work during my graduate program. However, as time progress I'll be uploading some more content that showcases concepts that I review or learn brand new.

Cheers.
